      <p>
        Scaling superconducting qubits while preserving performance is one of quantum computing’s toughest challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        We go beyond traditional brute-force scaling by decoupling control from qubit count, enabling quantum computers to scale efficiently by design.
      </p>

      <h2>A Radical Approach to Scalability</h2>
      <p>
        Today’s quantum computers rely on dedicated control lines for each qubit, resulting in dense wiring that degrades qubit performance, inflates system footprint and cost, and fundamentally limits scalability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most solutions to wiring problems demand new hardware and nontrivial engineering, making scalability harder, not easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re charting a new path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our unique chip architecture uses shared control lines, drastically reducing wiring complexity while sidestepping the limits of conventional designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach enables a new generation of quantum computing systems — built on the most advanced qubit platforms and designed to scale from day one.
      </p>

      <h2>Powered by a New Way to Compute</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of our innovation lies a new control protocol — a new way to address and operate a qubit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional processors, in our chip all qubits are addressed simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through innovative engineering of qubit couplings, we exploit these globally broadcasted signals to selectively perform gate operations and move quantum information within the chip.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rethink information processing from first principles to increase hardware efficiency and fast-track the path to scalable, error-corrected, application-ready quantum computers.

        <h2>Open Software at Planckian</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that advancing quantum technologies requires openness and collaboration.
          Here we publish and maintain open-source software developed by Planckian — tools, simulators, and frameworks designed to accelerate progress in quantum control and computation.
