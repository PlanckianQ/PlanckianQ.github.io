# Planckian srl

**Planckian** develops scalable quantum computing architectures based on superconducting qubits.  
Our approach focuses on reducing control complexity while maintaining qubit performance.

## Architecture

Current quantum systems rely on dedicated control lines for each qubit, increasing wiring density, degrading performance, and limiting scalability.  

**Planckianâ€™s architecture** employs shared control lines, minimizing hardware overhead and improving scalability.

---

## Control Protocol

Our **control protocol** enables simultaneous addressing of qubits through global signals.  
Engineered qubit couplings allow selective operations and data movement across the chip, simplifying control and improving efficiency.

## Open Software

This page hosts **open-source software** developed by Planckian in support of our research in scalable quantum and global control and computation.  

Source code and documentation are available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/).
